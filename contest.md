----|------|------|------|--------|----------|
1 | 4009 | [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1293/standings/page/21) | Real | Don't give up. You can do better. |======|
2 | 3917 | [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1285) | Virual | Easy implementation needs to be correct | 1 |
3 | 2726 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1287) | Virtual | Try to use std::set less &nbsp; [TLE](https://codeforces.com/contest/1287/submission/69266103) &nbsp; [AC](https://codeforces.com/contest/1287/submission/) &nbsp; and get better at dp. 1700 problems are not tough, don't be afraid. | 2 |
4 | 1809 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1294/standings/page/10) | Real | DO NOT GIVE UP. EVEN ON LAST MINUTE. Reduce WA submissions. And get a template library rather than coding everything on the spot. Changing ```int``` to ```long``` can have severe effects [MLE](https://codeforces.com/contest/1294/submission/69364778) &nbsp; [AC](https://codeforces.com/contest/1294/submission/69367029) | ====== |
5 | 232 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1283/standings/page/2) | Virtual | Fast + Correct attempt does magic. And yes, 1800 are easy. | ====== |
6 | 2075 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1271/standings/page/11) | Virtual | These practice won't help unless you are serious. Laziness will result in catestrophe. | ====== |
7 | 1894 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1279) | Virtual | Again ! THE TEMPLATE !!! Get it ASAP | ====== | 
8 | 610 | [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc153/standings) | Real | ABC Contests are waste of time. Go for AGC or Codeforces | Not Required |
8 | 2715 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1282) | Virtual | You Know it ! | 2 | 
9 | =====| ===================== | ======= | Power Cut is just an excuse to hide laziness. | ====== |
10| 3050 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1295/standings/participant/32280114#p32280114) | Real | Literally ? Neither accurate nor fast ? Need to work lot more. | 1 |
11 | 702 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1269/standings/page/4) | Virtual | Game Changes when you are accurate and fast as well. | ====== | 
12 | 1758 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1281/standings/page/9) | Virtual | Need to improve accuracy | 0 |
13 | 2841 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1291/) | Real | .... | ====== |
14 | 3654 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1263) | Virtual | EASY MUST BE ACCEPTED | ====== |
15 | 750 | [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1296) | Real | 500+ submissions in div3 => Easy | 1 |


* log(n) is not always negligible. Especially when there is already a log(n) factor. i.e. O(n) and O(n*log(n)*log(n)) differ alot
* Try doing [this](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/543/A) by recursive dp :) Seems iterative is much more useful here.
[TLE](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/385/72215293) to [AC](https://codeforces.com/problemset/submission/385/72215637) by changing map to array.
