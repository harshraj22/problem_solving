</strong>Problem Statement</strong>: You need to write code to implement a Vending machine that
    has a bunch of products like chocolates, candy, cold-drink, and accept some
    coins like Nickle, Dime, Quarter, Cent, etc. Make sure you insert a coin,
    get a product back, and get your chance back. Also, write the Unit test to
    demonstrate that these common use cases work.
